This may be for a variety of reason. First of all, some errnio features like our search or share bar  dare only made visible when users perform an initial scroll on your mobile site. Other reasons have to do with your device or browser cache, which often take time to refresh. Please also make sure you are testing our products within a supported mobile device, browser and operating system, on mobile (we do not operate on desktop).
